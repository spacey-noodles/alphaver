- Considered himself friends with 4 ([Internal footage 3](../videos/internal-footage-3.md))
- *May have been kicked out of the dev team for doing things against the rules (such as entering worlds and recording himself doing it)— if this is the case, they don’t seem to view it as having done something wrong* (“Internal footage 2 [reupload]”; “Internal footage 1”)
- While working on Minecraft, was working on the main game ([Internal footage 2](../videos/internal-footage-2.md))
